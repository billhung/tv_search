00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I think that people like me who have good taste.

1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
People who are "white collared"

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
It's natural we should drive nice cars.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
That's why Honda is my favorite brand.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
When you drive a nice car, it's like you're flying.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So when I drive my Honda, I feel like the whole world is flying.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I'm driving, people are envious of me.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Only people who drive Hondas can have this feeling.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
One day, I was passed by a red QQ car.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I thought "How dare this QQ driver try pass a Honda".

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
This guy was looking for trouble.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Not only should you not disrespect a Honda, you should never disrespect someone who's  white collared.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I easily just stepped on the gas and forced the QQ off the road.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
QQ's are such terrible cars. Without even saying a word, I vandalized the QQ.

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The QQ driver was furious, but I calmly said:

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Driving a QQ wasn't your mistake. Your mistake was trying to challenge a Honda.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You can't possible match up to a Honda.

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Take me for example. Someone with so much taste.

18
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
An ideal white collared person.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And then look at my car. So valuable. So luxurious.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Because you dared pass me, you deserve to have your car vandalized.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
All the people who were watching began applauding.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I left to a rousing ovation.
